# COVID-19 Exploratory and Statistical Analysis

## Goals
The goal of this project is to answer certain questions that can be made from looing at the datset through the use of data manipulation in SQL and then visualizing our queries using R and creating a dasboard in Tableau.
The datsets that are used in this project contain information such as vaccination count, death count, location, time, icu patients, etc...
Skills that were used in this project: Aggregate functions, CTE, Join and Group By, ggplot

Some questions that can be answered by looking at this dataset are:

 - Which countries have the highest amount of cases/deaths?
 - Which countries have the highest death rate/vaccination rate?
 - Which continents have the hightest death/case count?
 - Which countries have the lowest/highest infection rate?
 
 ## Analysis
 1. Which counties have the highest amount of cases/deaths
 Looking at our query results, we can see that the top 3 countries with the highest amount of deaths are the United States, Brazil, and Mexico
